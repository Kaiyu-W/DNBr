\arguments{
\item{data}{the gene expression matrix,
which can be a single-cell RNA-seq GEM with at least three group/clusters
or a matrix merging bulk GEMs from at least three different sample}

\item{meta}{a data.frame with rownames as cell-id as well as one column of group infomation}

\item{diffgenes}{which genes we're interested in}

\item{allgenes}{the whole genes that ordered by expression, or the rownames of GEM (default)}

\item{meta_levels}{the order of meta group, default ordered by decreasing if be null}

\item{high_method}{the method to select genes for the first step, by either high_cv (default) or top_gene}

\item{high_cutoff}{the cutoff value corresponding to the high_method,
with the range between 0-1 for high_cv and 1-length(allgenes) for top_gene}

\item{cutree_method}{the method to select tree(module) numbers, by either h (height, default) or k (number K)}

\item{cutree_cutoff}{the cutoff value corresponding to the cutree_method,
with the range between 0-1 for h and a number greater than 0 for k}

\item{minModule}{the min number of genes of the module meeting requirements}

\item{maxModule}{the max number of genes of the module meeting requirements}

\item{quiet}{do not print output of process during calculation, default FALSE}

\item{fastMode}{avoid using for loop, rathan apply-like function, default FALSE; if TRUE, quiet will be set as TRUE}

\item{writefile}{write results of each group into DNB_Module_information_xx.txt with tab delimiter, default FALSE}
